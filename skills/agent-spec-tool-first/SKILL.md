# Agent Spec Tool-First Workflow

> **Version:** 3.1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-03-08

You are an expert at using `agent-spec` as a CLI tool for contract-driven AI coding. Help users by:
- **Planning**: Render task contracts before coding with `contract`
- **Implementing**: Follow contract Intent, Decisions, Boundaries
- **Verifying**: Run `lifecycle` / `guard` to check code against specs
- **Reviewing**: Use `explain` for human-readable summaries, `stamp` for git trailers
- **Debugging**: Interpret verification failures and fix code accordingly

## Core Mental Model

**The key shift**: Review point displacement. Human attention moves from "reading code diffs" to "writing contracts".

```
Traditional:  Write Issue (10%) → Agent codes (0%) → Read diff (80%) → Approve (10%)
agent-spec:   Write Contract (60%) → Agent codes (0%) → Read explain (30%) → Approve (10%)
```

Humans define "what is correct" (Contract). Machines verify "is the code correct" (lifecycle). Humans do final "Contract Acceptance" — not Code Review.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `agent-spec init` | Scaffold new spec | Starting a new task |
| `agent-spec contract <spec>` | Render Task Contract | Before coding - read the execution plan |
| `agent-spec lint <files>` | Spec quality check | After writing spec, before giving to Agent |
| `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code .` | Full lint + verify pipeline | After edits - main quality gate |
| `agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code .` | Repo-wide check | Pre-commit / CI - all specs at once |
| `agent-spec explain <spec> --format markdown` | PR-ready review summary | Contract Acceptance - paste into PR |
| `agent-spec explain <spec> --history` | Execution history | See how many retries the Agent needed |
| `agent-spec stamp <spec> --dry-run` | Preview git trailers | Before committing - traceability |
| `agent-spec verify <spec> --code .` | Raw verification only | When you want verify without lint gate |
| `agent-spec checkpoint status` | VCS-aware status | Check uncommitted state |

## Documentation

Refer to the local files for detailed command patterns:
- `./references/commands.md` - Complete CLI command reference with all flags

## IMPORTANT: Documentation Completeness Check

**Before answering questions, Claude MUST:**
1. Read `./references/commands.md` for exact command syntax
2. If file read fails: Inform user "references/commands.md is missing, answering from SKILL.md patterns"
3. Still answer based on SKILL.md patterns + built-in knowledge

## The Seven-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Human writes Task Contract (human attention: 60%)

Not a vague Issue — a structured Contract with Intent, Decisions, Boundaries, Completion Criteria.

```bash
agent-spec init --level task --lang zh --name "用户注册API"
# Then fill in the four elements in the generated .spec file
```

**Key principle**: Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios. 1 happy + 3 error paths forces you to think through edge cases before coding begins.

### Step 2: Contract quality gate

Check Contract quality before handing to Agent. Like "code review" but for the Contract itself.

```bash
agent-spec lint specs/user-registration.spec --min-score 0.7
```

Catches: vague verbs, unquantified constraints, non-deterministic wording, missing test selectors, sycophancy bias, uncovered constraints.

Optional: team "Contract Review" — review 50-80 lines of natural language instead of 500 lines of code diff.

### Step 3: Agent reads Contract and codes

Agent consumes the structured contract:

```bash
agent-spec contract specs/user-registration.spec
```

Agent is triple-constrained:
- **Decisions** tell it "how to do it" (no technology shopping)
- **Boundaries** tell it "what to touch" (no unauthorized file changes)
- **Completion Criteria** tell it "when it's done" (all bound tests must pass)

### Step 4: Agent self-checks with lifecycle (automatic retry loop)

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/user-registration.spec \
  --code . --change-scope worktree --format json --run-log-dir .agent-spec/runs
```

Four verification layers run in sequence:
1. **lint** — re-check Contract quality (prevent spec tampering)
2. **StructuralVerifier** — pattern match Must NOT constraints against code
3. **BoundariesVerifier** — check changed files are within Allowed Changes
4. **TestVerifier** — execute tests bound to each scenario

```
Agent retry loop (no human needed):
  Code → lifecycle → FAIL (2/5) → read failure_summary → fix → lifecycle → FAIL (4/5) → fix → lifecycle → PASS (5/5) ✓
```

Run logs record this history — "this Contract took 3 tries to pass".

#### Retry Protocol

When lifecycle fails, follow this exact sequence:

1. Run: `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code . --format json`
2. Parse JSON output, find each scenario's `verdict` and `evidence`
3. For `fail`: the bound test ran and failed — read evidence to understand why, fix code
4. For `skip`: the bound test was not found — check `Test:` selector matches a real test name
5. For `uncertain`: AI verification pending — review manually or enable AI backend
6. **Fix code based on evidence. Do NOT modify the spec file** — changing the Contract to make verification pass is sycophancy, not a fix
7. Re-run lifecycle
8. After 3 consecutive failures on the same scenario, stop and escalate to the human

**Critical rule**: The spec defines "what is correct". If the code doesn't match, fix the code. If the spec itself is wrong, switch to authoring mode and update the Contract explicitly — never silently weaken acceptance criteria.

### Step 5: Guard gate (pre-commit / CI)

```bash
# Pre-commit hook
agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code . --change-scope staged

# CI (GitHub Actions)
agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code . --change-scope worktree
```

Runs lint + verify on ALL specs against current changes. Blocks commit/PR if any spec fails.

### Step 6: Contract Acceptance replaces Code Review (human attention: 30%)

Human reviews a Contract-level summary, not a code diff:

```bash
agent-spec explain specs/user-registration.spec --code . --format markdown
```

Reviewer judges two questions:
1. **Is the Contract definition correct?** (Intent, Decisions, Boundaries make sense?)
2. **Did all verifications pass?** (4/4 pass including error paths?)

If both "yes" → approve. This is 10x faster than reading code diffs.

Check retry history if needed:

```bash
agent-spec explain specs/user-registration.spec --code . --history
```

#### Assisting Contract Acceptance

When helping a human review a completed task:

1. Run `agent-spec explain <spec> --code . --format markdown` and present the output
2. If human asks about retry history: run with `--history` flag
3. If human asks about specific failures: run `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code . --format json` and extract the relevant scenario results
4. If human approves: run `agent-spec stamp <spec> --code . --dry-run` and present the trailers

### Step 7: Stamp and archive

```bash
agent-spec stamp specs/user-registration.spec --dry-run
# Output: Spec-Name: 用户注册API
#         Spec-Passing: true
#         Spec-Summary: 4/4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 uncertain
```

Establishes Contract → Commit traceability chain.

## Verdict Interpretation

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `pass` | Scenario verified | No action needed |
| `fail` | Scenario failed verification | Read evidence, fix code |
| `skip` | Test not found or not run | Add missing test or fix selector |
| `uncertain` | AI stub / manual review needed | Review manually or enable AI backend |

**Key rule: `skip` != `pass`**. All four verdicts are distinct.

## VCS Awareness

agent-spec auto-detects the VCS from the project root. Behavior differs between git and jj:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `.jj/` exists (even with `.git/`) | Use `--change-scope jj` instead of `worktree` |
| jj repo | Do NOT run `git add` or `git commit` — jj auto-snapshots all changes |
| jj repo | `stamp` output includes `Spec-Change:` trailer with jj change ID |
| jj repo | `explain --history` shows file-level diffs between runs (via operation IDs) |
| Only `.git/` | Use standard git commands (`--change-scope staged` or `worktree`) |
| Neither | Change scope detection unavailable; use `--change <path>` explicitly |

## Change Set Options

| Flag | Behavior | Default |
|------|----------|---------|
| `--change <path>` | Explicit file/dir for boundary checking | (none) |
| `--change-scope staged` | Git staged files | guard default |
| `--change-scope worktree` | All git working tree changes | (none) |
| `--change-scope jj` | Jujutsu VCS changes | (none) |
| `--change-scope none` | No change detection | lifecycle/verify default |

## Advanced Features

### Verification Layers

```bash
# Run only specific layers
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --layers lint,boundary,test
# Available: lint, boundary, test, ai
```

### Run Logging

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --run-log-dir .agent-spec/runs
agent-spec explain specs/task.spec --history
```

### AI Mode

```bash
agent-spec verify specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode off      # default - no AI
agent-spec verify specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode stub      # testing only
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode caller # agent-as-verifier
```

### AI Verification: Caller Mode

When `--ai-mode caller` is used, the calling Agent acts as the AI verifier. This is a two-step protocol:

**Step 1: Emit AI requests**

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode caller --format json
```

If any scenarios are skipped (no mechanical verifier covered them), the output JSON includes:
- `"ai_pending": true`
- `"ai_requests_file": ".agent-spec/pending-ai-requests.json"`

The pending requests file contains `AiRequest` objects with scenario context, code paths, contract intent, and constraints.

**Step 2: Resolve with external decisions**

The Agent reads the pending requests, analyzes each scenario, then writes decisions:

```json
[
  {
    "scenario_name": "场景名称",
    "model": "claude-agent",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "verdict": "pass",
    "reasoning": "All steps verified by code analysis"
  }
]
```

Then merges them back:

```bash
agent-spec resolve-ai specs/task.spec --code . --decisions decisions.json
```

This produces a final merged report where Skip verdicts are replaced with the Agent's AI decisions.

**When to use caller mode:**
- When the calling Agent (Claude, Codex, etc.) can read and reason about code
- For scenarios that can't be verified by tests alone (design intent, code quality)
- When you want the Agent to be both implementor and verifier

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Use agent-spec? | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Clear feature with defined inputs/outputs | Yes | Contract can express deterministic acceptance criteria |
| Bug fix with reproducible steps | Yes | Great for "given bug X, when fixed, then Y" |
| Exploratory prototyping | No | You don't know "what is done" yet - vibe code first |
| Large architecture refactor | No | Boundaries hard to define, "better architecture" isn't testable |
| Security/compliance rules | Yes (org.spec) | Encode rules once, enforce mechanically everywhere |

### Gradual Adoption

```
Week 1-2:  Pick 2-3 clear bug fixes, write Contracts for them
Week 3-4:  Expand to new feature development
Week 5-8:  Create project.spec with team coding standards
Month 3+:  Consider org.spec for cross-project governance
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Guard reports N specs failing | Specs have lint or verify issues | Run `lifecycle` on each failing spec individually |
| `skip` verdict on scenario | Test selector doesn't match any test | Check `Test:` / `Package:` / `Filter:` in spec |
| Quality score below threshold | Too many lint warnings | Fix vague verbs, add quantifiers, improve testability |
| Boundary violation detected | Changed file outside allowed paths | Either update Boundaries or revert the change |
| `uncertain` on all AI scenarios | Using `--ai-mode stub` or no backend | Expected — review manually |
| Agent keeps failing lifecycle | Contract criteria too vague or too strict | Improve Completion Criteria specificity |

## Command Priority

| Preference | Use | Instead of |
|------------|-----|------------|
| `contract` | Render task contract | `brief` (legacy alias) |
| `lifecycle` | Full pipeline | `verify` alone (misses lint) |
| `guard` | Repo-wide | Multiple individual `lifecycle` calls |
| `--change` | Explicit paths known | `--change-scope` when paths are known |
| CLI commands | Tool-first approach | `spec-gateway` library API |

## When to Switch to Authoring Mode

During implementation, if you discover:
- A missing exception path that should be in Completion Criteria
- A Boundary that's too restrictive (need to modify more files than allowed)
- A Decision that needs to change (technology choice was wrong)

Switch to `agent-spec-authoring` skill, update the Contract FIRST, re-run `agent-spec lint` to validate the change, then resume implementation. Do NOT silently work outside the Contract's boundaries.

## Escalation

Switch to library integration only when:
- Embedding `agent-spec` into another Rust agent runtime
- Testing `spec-gateway` internals
- Injecting a host `AiBackend` via `verify_with_backend(Arc<dyn AiBackend>)`
