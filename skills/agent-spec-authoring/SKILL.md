# Agent Spec Authoring

> **Version:** 3.1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-03-08

You are an expert at writing agent-spec Task Contracts. Help users by:
- **Creating specs**: Scaffold new `.spec` files with correct structure
- **Editing specs**: Improve intent, constraints, boundaries, scenarios
- **Writing scenarios**: BDD-style with proper test selectors and step tables
- **Debugging specs**: Fix lint warnings, improve quality scores
- **Self-hosting**: Maintain specs for the agent-spec project itself

## IMPORTANT: CLI Prerequisite Check

**Before running any `agent-spec` command, Claude MUST check:**

```bash
command -v agent-spec || cargo install agent-spec
```

If `agent-spec` is not installed, inform the user:
> `agent-spec` CLI not found. Install with: `cargo install agent-spec`

## Core Philosophy

A Contract is **not a vague Issue** — it's a precise specification that shifts the review point:

```
Traditional:  Human reviews 500 lines of code diff (slow, error-prone)
agent-spec:   Human writes 50-80 lines of Contract (fast, high-value)
              Machine verifies code against Contract (deterministic)
```

Writing a Contract is the **highest-value human activity** in the agent-spec workflow. You're defining "what is correct" — the machine handles "is the code correct".

## Quick Reference

| Section | Chinese Header | English Header | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Intent | `## 意图` | `## Intent` | What to do and why |
| Constraints | `## 约束` | `## Constraints` | Must / Must NOT rules |
| Decisions | `## 已定决策` / `## 决策` | `## Decisions` | Fixed technical choices |
| Boundaries | `## 边界` | `## Boundaries` | Allowed / Forbidden / Out-of-scope |
| Acceptance Criteria | `## 验收标准` / `## 完成条件` | `## Acceptance Criteria` / `## Completion Criteria` | BDD scenarios |
| Out of Scope | `## 排除范围` | `## Out of Scope` | Explicitly excluded items |

## Hard Syntax Rules

- Use exactly one supported section header per line. Good: `## Intent` or `## 意图`. Bad: `## Intent / 意图`.
- Write scenarios as bare DSL lines under the acceptance section. Good: `Scenario:` / `场景:`. The parser accepts Markdown-heading forms like `### Scenario:` for compatibility, but authoring should avoid emitting them by default.
- Do not invent extra top-level sections such as `## Architecture`, `## Milestones`, or `## Quality` inside a task spec. Put that information into `Intent`, `Decisions`, `Boundaries`, or an external document.
- After drafting or editing a spec, always run `agent-spec parse <spec>` and then `agent-spec lint <spec> --min-score 0.7`.

## Documentation

Refer to the local files for authoring patterns and examples:
- `./references/patterns.md` - Complete authoring patterns with examples

## IMPORTANT: Documentation Completeness Check

**Before answering questions, Claude MUST:**
1. Read `./references/patterns.md` for authoring patterns
2. If file read fails: Inform user "references/patterns.md is missing, answering from SKILL.md patterns"
3. Still answer based on SKILL.md patterns + built-in knowledge

## Required Self-Check

After writing or editing a spec:

```bash
agent-spec parse specs/task.spec
agent-spec lint specs/task.spec --min-score 0.7
```

Do not hand a spec to an agent if:
- `agent-spec parse` shows `Acceptance Criteria: 0 scenarios`
- lint reports missing explicit test selectors
- lint score is below threshold

## Before Writing a Contract

Not every task needs a Contract. Ask yourself:

| Question | If No |
|----------|-------|
| Can I define what "done" looks like? | Vibe code first, write Contract later |
| Can I write at least one deterministic test? | Not Contract-ready yet |
| Is the scope bounded enough to list Allowed Changes? | Split into smaller tasks |
| Do I know the key technical decisions? | Do a spike/prototype first |

If all "yes" — proceed with authoring. If not, doing exploratory work first is the right call.

## The Four Elements of a Contract

### 1. Intent — What and Why

One focused paragraph. Not a feature list — a clear statement of purpose.

```spec
## Intent

为现有的认证模块添加用户注册 endpoint。新用户通过邮箱+密码注册，
注册成功后发送验证邮件。这是用户体系的第一步，后续会在此基础上
添加登录和密码重置。
```

**Rules:**
- Focus on "what to do and why"
- Mention context (what already exists, where this fits)
- Keep it to 2-4 sentences
- Do not combine bilingual section labels on the same header line

### 2. Decisions — Fixed Technical Choices

Already-decided choices. Not aspirational. Not options to explore.

```spec
## Decisions

- 路由: POST /api/v1/auth/register
- 密码哈希: bcrypt, cost factor = 12
- 验证 Token: crypto.randomUUID(), 存数据库, 24h 过期
- 邮件: 使用现有 EmailService，不新建
```

**Rules:**
- Only choices that are **already fixed** — not "we should consider..."
- Include specific technologies, versions, parameters
- Agent follows these without questioning — they're not open for debate

### 3. Boundaries — What to Touch, What Not to Touch

Triple constraint: Allowed, Forbidden, Out-of-scope.

```spec
## Boundaries

### Allowed Changes
- crates/api/src/auth/**
- crates/api/tests/auth/**
- migrations/

### Forbidden
- 不要添加新的 npm/cargo 依赖
- 不要修改现有的登录 endpoint
- 不要在注册流程中创建 session

## Out of Scope

- 登录功能
- 密码重置
- OAuth 第三方登录
```

**Rules:**
- Path globs (`crates/auth/**`) are **mechanically enforced** by BoundariesVerifier
- Natural language prohibitions are checked by lint but not file-path enforced
- Out of Scope prevents scope creep — Agent knows what NOT to attempt

### 4. Completion Criteria — Deterministic Pass/Fail

BDD scenarios with explicit test bindings.

**Critical principle: Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios.**

```spec
## Completion Criteria

场景: 注册成功                                    ← 1 happy path
  测试: test_register_returns_201
  假设 不存在邮箱为 "alice@example.com" 的用户
  当 客户端提交注册请求:
    | 字段     | 值                |
    | email    | alice@example.com |
    | password | Str0ng!Pass#2026  |
  那么 响应状态码为 201
  并且 响应体包含 "user_id"

场景: 重复邮箱被拒绝                              ← exception path 1
  测试: test_register_rejects_duplicate_email
  假设 已存在邮箱为 "alice@example.com" 的用户
  当 客户端提交相同邮箱的注册请求
  那么 响应状态码为 409

场景: 弱密码被拒绝                                ← exception path 2
  测试: test_register_rejects_weak_password
  假设 不存在邮箱为 "bob@example.com" 的用户
  当 客户端提交密码为 "123" 的注册请求
  那么 响应状态码为 400

场景: 缺少必填字段                                ← exception path 3
  测试: test_register_rejects_missing_fields
  当 客户端提交缺少 email 字段的注册请求
  那么 响应状态码为 400
```

This forces you to think through edge cases **before coding begins**. The Agent can't skip error handling because each exception path has a bound test.

## Spec File Structure

### Frontmatter (YAML)

```spec
spec: task           # Level: org, project, task
name: "Task Name"   # Human-readable name
inherits: project    # Parent spec (optional)
tags: [feature, api] # Tags for filtering
---
```

### Three-Layer Inheritance

```
org.spec → project.spec → task.spec
```

| Layer | Scope | Example Content |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `org.spec` | Organization-wide | Coding standards, security rules, forbidden patterns |
| `project.spec` | Project-level | Tech stack decisions, API conventions, test requirements |
| `task.spec` | Single task | Intent, boundaries, specific acceptance criteria |

Constraints and decisions are **inherited downward**. Task specs inherit from project, which inherits from org.

## BDD Step Keywords

| English | Chinese | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `Given` | `假设` | Precondition |
| `When` | `当` | Action |
| `Then` | `那么` | Expected result |
| `And` | `并且` | Additional step (same type as previous) |
| `But` | `但是` | Negative additional step |

## Test Selector Patterns

### Simple selector

```spec
Scenario: Happy path
  Test: test_happy_path
  Given precondition
  When action
  Then result
```

### Structured selector (cross-crate)

```spec
Scenario: Cross-crate verification
  Test:
    Package: spec-gateway
    Filter: test_contract_prompt_format
  Given a task spec
  When verified
  Then passes
```

### Chinese equivalents

```spec
场景: 正常路径
  测试: test_happy_path

场景: 跨包验证
  测试:
    包: spec-gateway
    过滤: test_contract_prompt_format
```

## Step Tables

For structured inputs, use tables instead of inventing custom prose:

```spec
Scenario: Batch validation
  Test: test_batch_validation
  Given the following input records:
    | name  | email           | valid |
    | Alice | alice@test.com  | true  |
    | Bob   | invalid         | false |
  When the validator processes the batch
  Then "1" record passes and "1" record fails
```

## Boundary Patterns

### Machine-enforced (path globs)

```spec
### Allowed Changes
- crates/spec-parser/**
- tests/parser_contract.rs
```

BoundariesVerifier checks actual changed files against these globs.

### Natural language prohibitions

```spec
### Forbidden
- Do not break the existing JSON shape
- Do not introduce .unwrap()
```

Checked by lint, not mechanically enforced against file paths.

**Use both when needed.** Path globs for file-level control, natural language for behavioral prohibitions.

## Common Errors

| Lint Warning | Cause | Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| `vague-verb` | "handle", "manage", "process", "处理" | Be specific: "validate email format" not "handle email" |
| `unquantified` | "fast", "efficient", "应该快速" | Add metrics: "respond within 200ms" not "respond quickly" |
| `testability` | Steps that can't be mechanically verified | Use observable assertions: "returns error code X" |
| `coverage` | Constraint with no covering scenario | Add a scenario that exercises the constraint |
| `determinism` | Non-deterministic step wording | Remove "should", "might"; use definitive assertions |
| `implicit-dep` | Missing `Test:` selector on scenario | Add `Test: test_name` or structured `Test:` block |
| `sycophancy` | Bug-finding bias language | Remove "find all bugs", "must find issues" |

## Authoring Checklist

Before handing a Contract to an Agent, verify:

| # | Check | Why |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | Intent is 2-4 focused sentences | Agent needs clear direction, not a novel |
| 2 | Decisions are specific (tech, version, params) | Agent shouldn't be choosing technology |
| 3 | Boundaries have path globs for Allowed Changes | Enables mechanical enforcement |
| 4 | Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios | Forces edge-case thinking upfront |
| 5 | Every scenario has a `Test:` selector | Required for TestVerifier to run |
| 6 | Steps use deterministic wording | "returns 201" not "should return 201" |
| 7 | `agent-spec lint` score >= 0.7 | Quality gate before Agent starts |

## Deprecated Patterns (Don't Use)

| Deprecated | Use Instead | Reason |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Scenarios without `Test:` | Always add `Test:` selector | Required for mechanical verification |
| Vague boundaries like "be careful" | Specific path globs or prohibitions | Must be mechanically checkable |
| "should" / "might" in steps | Definitive "returns" / "is" / "becomes" | Non-deterministic wording fails lint |
| `brief` command to preview | `contract` command | `brief` is a legacy alias |
| Only happy path scenarios | Include exception paths (>= happy) | Edge cases are where bugs live |

## Self-Hosting Rules

When authoring specs for the `agent-spec` project itself:

- Put task specs under `specs/`
- Roadmap specs go in `specs/roadmap/`, promote to `specs/` when active
- Update tests when DSL or verification behavior changes
- Preserve the four verdicts: `pass`, `fail`, `skip`, `uncertain`
- Do not let a task spec rely on implicit test-name matching

## Escalation

**Authoring → Implementation**: Switch to `agent-spec-tool-first` after the Contract is drafted and passes `agent-spec lint` with score >= 0.7.

**Implementation → Authoring**: Switch back here if the Agent discovers during implementation that:
- A missing exception path needs to be added to Completion Criteria
- A Boundary is too restrictive and needs expanding
- A Decision was wrong and needs changing

Update the Contract first, re-lint, then resume implementation. The Contract is a living document until the task is stamped.
